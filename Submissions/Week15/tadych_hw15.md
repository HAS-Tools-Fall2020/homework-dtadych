**Questions:**

1. What resources did you request on Ocelote? How long did you wait in the queue for your job to run and how long did it take to run?
*I requested 1 core with 6gb of memory.  The total time after I hit the "qsub bamboojungle.pbs" to seeing the output or error files took about 1 minute, so I don't think I waited in the queue long.  According to my output script, it took about 7 seconds to run my script because it was a very simple script.*
2. What was the most confusing part to you about setting up and running your job on Ocelote?
*making the pbs script was a little confusing to me at first.  Also in my pbs script I had to add a line to activate my environment in order for my script python script to run.*
What questions do you still have after doing this?
3. Where else did you run your job? How did the setup compare to your run on Ocelote?
*I ran it on puma through a jupyter notebook and the wait time was a little longer to approve my request.  This makes sense to me though because it would take more run (an hour compared to 5 minutes)*
4. What questions do you still have after doing this?
*Can you submit a job in puma through terminal?  When I tried it threw errors*
