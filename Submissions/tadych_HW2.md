## Danielle Tadych  - 9/7/2020 - Homework 2

I was having trouble reading in my data into python with visual studio, so I couldn't get it to plot that way, so instead I parsed last year's flow data through the usgs website and graphing capabilities.  Since last year's streamflow patterns are very similar due to drought I tried to be a little more precise this week by parsing out the graphs from weekly to monthly, without doing any calculations.

3/3 - Nice job! I'm glad you were able  to find a work around.  Please also make sure you come to office hours to get to the bottom of this as we will need to have everything working in python from here on out.
