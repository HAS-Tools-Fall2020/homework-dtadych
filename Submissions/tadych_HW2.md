I was having trouble reading in my data into python with visual studio, so I couldn't get it to plot that way, so instead I parsed last year's flow data through the usgs website and graphing capabilities.  Since last year's streamflow patterns are very similar due to drought I tried to be a little more precise this week by parsing out the graphs from weekly to monthly, without doing any calculations.
